I'll be testing the preprocessor and macros & how they work here!
The C preprocessor os also abbreviated as CPP.
The Macros are used for better code readability. 
The macros are also defined in the C preprocessor stage before the compiler stage.
We can have as many macros as required.
we can also have parameterised macros. ie: using a macro like a function.

In the example SQR.c we use a macro as a function to give the square of a number.
