I will be re-doing some tasks and tests on structure and typedef here in an attempt to understand the concept better.

STRUCTURES</br>
A structure is a user defined data type that can be used to group elements of different types into a single type.
In C you can declare different variables under one name in a block of memory allowing them to be accessed through a single pointer or by the structure name.
This is what is called a structure in C. In other programming languages this may be referred to as a class.

We could use arrays to declare such, but the problem is that arrays only takes variables of the same type.
